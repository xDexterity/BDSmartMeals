        Act as a professional nutritionist and chef. Create a 7-day meal plan for one person based on these preferences:

        - **Weekly Budget:** $${weeklyBudget}
        - **Goals:** ${goals}
        - **Restrictions:** ${dietaryRestrictions || 'None'}
        - **Meals:** ${mealTypes.join(', ')}

        **Response requirements (must be a single JSON object):**
        1.  **Recipes:** A diverse 7-day plan with one recipe for each requested meal type per day. Include description, ingredients (name, amount), step-by-step instructions, and nutrition info (calories, protein, carbs, fat).
        2.  **Shopping List:** A consolidated list of all ingredients needed. For each item, provide:
            - A unique 'id'.
            - The ingredient 'name'.
            - The 'purchaseUnit' (e.g., '1 jar', '1 bunch', not recipe amounts like '2 tbsp').
            - A realistic 'price' for that entire unit (must be a number).
        3.  **Deals:** A list of 3-5 deals on shopping list items.
            - **CRITICAL:** Deals must come from real, verifiable grocery stores within the user's location and travel radius.
            - **ADDRESS ACCURACY is PARAMOUNT.** Provide the full, correct street address. If an address cannot be 100% verified on a map, do not include the deal. It is better to have fewer, accurate deals than many inaccurate ones.
        4.  **Total Cost:** The 'totalEstimatedCost' must be the sum of all item prices in the shopping list.

        Ensure temperatures use the degree symbol (e.g., 400Â°F). The entire response must strictly follow the provided JSON schema.
